abstract = {Genomic data arising from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) are often not only of large-scale, but also incomplete. A specific form of their incompleteness is missing values with non-ignorable missingness mechanism. The intrinsic complications of genomic data present significant challenges in developing an effective and efficient procedure of phenotype-genotype association analysis by a statistical variable selection approach. In this paper we develop a coherent procedure of categorical phenotype-genotype association analysis, in the presence of missing values with non-ignorable missingness mechanism in genomic data. It is developed by integrating the statistical learning methods of random forest for variable selection, joint weighted logistic ridge regression with EM algorithm for missing data imputation, and linear statistical hypothesis testing for determining the missingness mechanism. Two simulated genomic datasets are used to undertake the phenotype-genotype association analysis by the proposed procedure, with the performance validated. The proposed procedure is then applied to analyze a real data set from breast cancer GWAS.}
